# JavaScript-Issue-Tracker
A pure JavaScript issue tracker that gets, saves, delete, and update from your local storage.

## How It's Made: 
HTML, BootStrap, JavaScript, Chance.js

## Lessons Learned: 
This app provided me with valuable insights into building a fully functional application using JavaScript alone, without relying on frontend frameworks. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to handle client-side data input and store it in the browser's local storage. This approach allowed me to save client issues without the need for a separate database, particularly for smaller data sets.

Furthermore, I successfully implemented a mechanism to retrieve and display the saved issues from the storage. By utilizing the innerHTML property, I was able to present the retrieved data directly on the client side, providing a seamless user experience.

To enhance usability, I incorporated features that enable the client to close or completely delete specific issues within the app. This functionality empowers the user to manage their issues efficiently and tailor the application to their needs.

Overall, this project served as an excellent opportunity to develop my JavaScript skills while creating a practical application that showcased the capabilities of the language without relying on external frameworks.
